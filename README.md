# modular-sass
A boilerplate to quickly get your application going with SASS.
(Note: this is a very slow, ongoing WIP).

## Getting started
- Clone and cd into the project directory
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Install gulp globally if you haven't already (`npm install -g gulp`)
- Start watching: run `gulp` 
and you're good to go! 

### Prerequisites 
node, npm, gulp
